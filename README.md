# FNaF-save-cheat
This script developed in Powershell takes the modified save of FNaF 1, 2, 3, 4 and Sister Location and put into %appdata%\MMFApplications directory.

> If you will use the script, remember to activate Powershell script execution on your Windows.

```Powershell
# For Activate
Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned

# For Deactivate
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

# If the options above don't work try this
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

# A cool thing to do...
A cool thing to do would be to gather some saves from fan games like Five Nights At Candy's. The objective would be to create a database containing this type of file.
